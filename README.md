# Udacity-project(Airline On-Time Performance Data)
## by (Jane Harry)


## Dataset
 
 The airline on-time  performance dataset name reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008. The data is collected by the Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). For this project, I used data for the year 2007 due to space limitaions.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the month of the year, and whether or not flights were cancelled. The counts of flight taking place on a monthly basis were roughly similar, but August had a slightly higher count, and February experienced the least amount of flight. On a daily basis, the least amount of flights occurred during the weekends on Saturdays, and Sundays(DayofWeek	1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)).  Of the total volume of flights that was recorded, only a small percent was cancelled or diverted. The most frequent reasons for cancellation is as a result of the carrier, followed by weather conditions. The most popular carrier used in this dataset is the WN--Southwest Airlines Co. followed by AA--American Airlines Inc. Also, MQ, AA, and OO are the top three UniqueCarriers with cancelled flights. WN had a lower amount of cancelled flights compared to the volume of flights it conducted. For delayed flights, WN, AA, AND MQ are the Carriers that experienced the most delays before departures. AA can be seen to have a high cancellation and departure delays. ORD, ATL and DFW are the three top cities that experienced both delay and cancellations. The data als revealed a common phenmenon, As the distance of a trip increases, the actual Elapsed Time also increases. There are also more departure delays among distances that are less than 3000 miles. Beyond that, the departure delays decreases. EV: Atlantic Southeast Airlines, B6: JetBlue Airways, AA: American Airlines Inc. are the top airlines with delayed flights, while HA: Hawaiian Airlines Inc. Departed, and arrived ahead of schedule. For monthly delays, June, and December, experienced the most frequent delays for both arrival and departures. December to March had very high cancellatins of flights due to weather, with the peak occuring in February. For delayed flights The most common cause of delays was due to LateAirCraft, followed by carrier delays. 


## Key Insights for Presentation


For the presentation, I focus on the causes of delays. I start by introducing the Unique Carriers, and then present the Carriers responsible for Delays. Next, I present the pattern of delays on a  monthly basis, and finally, I explore the various reasons for delay on a monthly basis. The bar charts are grouped by months, and the type of delay is color-coded, while the line graph depicting reasons for delay is color-coded on the delays.
